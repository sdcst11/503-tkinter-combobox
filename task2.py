##### Task 2 Calculator
Create a simple app that allows you to do a calculation with an arithmetic operation.  You will need a spinbox between 2 entry boxes.  The entryboxes are where you should be entering your numbers, and the spinbox should be the operator.  You will need a button to do the calculation.  You can modify your assignment from A500 for this.
