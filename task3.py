##### Task 3 tKinter Compound Interest 
Create an application to calculate the final value of a compount interest value problem.  Recall that the final value can be calculated with:

A = P(1+r/n)^(n*t) where:
P = Principal (amount of the initial investment)
r = Interest rate as a decimal (4% has r = 0.04)
n = Number of compounding periods in a year (monthly n = 12, daily n=365)
t = number of years

You should decide which values should have regular entry widgets, comboboxes or spinboxes.  You will need a label or entry box to show your result.
